DATASET 1: LIAR: A BENCHMARK DATASET FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION





DATASET 2:

politifact_fake.csv - Samples related to fake news collected from PolitiFact
politifact_real.csv - Samples related to real news collected from PolitiFact
gossipcop_fake.csv - Samples related to fake news collected from GossipCop
gossipcop_real.csv - Samples related to real news collected from GossipCop
Each of the above CSV files is comma separated file and have the following columns



id - Unique identifider for each news
url - Url of the article from web that published that news
title - Title of the news article
tweet_ids - Tweet ids of tweets sharing the news. This field is list of tweet ids separated by tab.




LIAR dataset and the politifact and gossipcop datasets all contain information related to news and its veracity. They can be combined to create a larger dataset that can be used for training models to detect fake news. Use one dataset to validate the other: two datasets contain different types of information, they can be used to validate each other: LIAR dataset can be used to validate the performance of models trained on the politifact and gossipcop datasets, and vice versa. We can use one dataset for feature engineering:The politifact and gossipcop datasets can be used to extract features related to the sources of news articles, which can be used to train models on the LIAR dataset. Also, this shows using ensemble methods: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy. By training models on both datasets and using ensemble methods, the overall performance of the model can be improved. In summary, combining datasets, using one dataset for feature engineering, and using ensemble methods can all be effective ways to use our two datasets. The most effective approach will depend on the specific research question and the nature of the data. It is important to note that using a model trained on one dataset to predict labels on another dataset may result in decreased performance due to differences in the data distributions.
