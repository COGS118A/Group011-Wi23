    "# Abstract \n",
    "As social media has become used from almost every person in the world, it has been easier for people to receive and share news. However, this easy access of news has also allowed it to be much easier to spread fake news. There are many platforms that purposely spread fake and biased news for their own benefit. It is very difficult for individuals to tell whether news is fake or real. Thus, this intentional spread of fake news is able to bring up many social conflicts, leading to disasters in the society. Therefore, it is very important for people to be able to correctly identify if the news they are reading is real or fake. The goal of our project is to solve this problem by using machine learning classifiers and correctly detecting if a news is real or fake. The data we are using is scraped from snopes.com which is a website that fact checks and analyzes information from the news. The variables in the dataset include: the title, comments by the public on the fact, claims to support the comment, label of the news (True, False, Miscaptioned), summary of the content, information that are true, false and unknown. We will be using these data to understand how each variable affects on the validity of the news content. In order to validate if the news is fake or not, we will be using multivariable logistic regression and SVM.   "

    "# Background\n",
    "As SNS spreads rapidly, fake news disguised as the media remains a major social problem. Fake news has become a particular public issue for the following reason:As online public opinion spheres are activated, people have diverse and easy access to platforms such as YouTube, and SNS. Unverified issues are produced and spread easily in that they can be freely spoken and shared information and opinions, making it easy for anyone to make news that may be extreme or wrongful, and spread them. Since 2017, academic research and discussion have gotten in earnest in the United States, where fake news remarked by Trump had been shifted to fake news.[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)According to previous discussions of fake news, fake news has been broadly defined as A) for political and economic gain, B) deliberately distorting and fabricating, and C) false information disguised as media coverage. [<sup>2</sup>](#fn2)With the introduction of artificial intelligence and various technology to distinguish fake news and unidentified information by SNS, media companies, also with the emergence of several fact-checking media show that media literacy has become a must for modern people. [<sup>3</sup>](#fn3) Machine Learning(ML) algorithm can be the solution. At first, the use of ML algorithm can detect fake news easily and automatically. In addition, the dataset can easily be collected to train calssifiers, especially supervised calssifiers. Since these classifiers depend on labelled datasets, by training these classifiers, we can identify fake news more accurately than from a human perspective."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Fake news damages certain people's reputation, violates someone’s privacy and personality rights and causes false prejudices against specific groups. Furthermore, it reduces the credibility of established media and other opinions and causes distortions in the process of forming political opinions. This causes social confusion and division, which harms civil society and its members and society as a whole. This is because it can cover facts and truths and spread false or distorted information to hinder the formation of sound public opinion. Naturally, such crackdowns and regulations on fake news are necessary. However, the biggest problem with fake news that we faced is that the current concept of fake news can be widespread and ambiguous. This is why the priority should be to find out what fake news is if legislation is to save damage to fake news. In a world of millions of news, they rely on manual human detection, so their scope is so limited that if the fake news is posted and deleted every minute, they cannot be manually responsible or executed. It can be a solution through the development of a system that provides reliable, automated exponential scores, namely trained machine learning.  solution through the development of a system that provides reliable, automated exponential scores, namely trained machine learning."

    "Benchmark model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: multivariable logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Library used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our problem is a multiclass classification of evaluating if the news is True, Mostly-true, Half-true, Barely-true, FALSE, Pants-fire (6 labels), we will be using multi-class logistic regression. In order to process the test into input data, we will be using vectorization. Then we will be adding this vectorized input to variables from multiple columns and evaluate whether the news is true or false. Thus, we will be using multivariable logistic regression. First of all, we will be dividing the dataset into training/validation set and test set. Next, because vectorizing the text into word units creates too many variables, we will be using normalization. Because we will be needing strong normalization, we believe that using L1 normalization will be effective. The search plane itself is a vectorized text, therefore it is possible for it to become very high dimension which may result in being stuck in the local minima. In order to prevent this problem, we will be using momentum in our training. Also, in order to quickly do weight updates in training, we will be using mini-batch. In the validation step, we will be using K-fold cross validation to retreive the most accurate model. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Text Processing\n",
    "After converting articles into token lists through CountVectorizer, TfidTransformer, and TfidVectorizer, vectorize them based on the count and frequency of appearance of tokens. In addition, TfidVectorier creates a BOW encoding vector that weights words in a TF-IDF, enabling document preprocessing. Using the TF-IDF method, you can manually adjust the parameter C to use an estimate that is a LogisticRegressionCV. Specifying cv=5, using kfold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. The criterion for model measurement is the accuracy of classification, and by setting it to n_jobs=-1, all CPU cores are dedicated. We’ll evaluate the performance by maximizing the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm.\n",

    "Using the same dataset and the same text method and train_test_split, we can create logistic regression models that classify news as real or fake news. After organizing and preprocessing text data, performing feature extraction, and building and distributing a logistic regression classifier using the scikit-learn, evaluate the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "Second, Using SVM(Support Vector Machines) to build classification prediction models and compare prediction accuracy on datasets for verification.\n",
    "Third, tree-based random forest. Using Adaboost to fit the shallow decision tree on the train set, and additional classifiers can be placed on the same data to correct errors and can be weighted. \n",

For Accuracy, we will be using (correctly evaluating that news is false + evaluating that news is false when it is actually true) / (correctly evaluating that news is false + correctly evaluating that news is true + evaluating that news is true when it is actually false + evaluating that news is false when it is actually true). Accuracy is important for our problem because it tells us if our model was able to accurately make correct predictions in evaluating that the news is false.

    "In our dataset, there may be some potential ethical concerns because we are retrieving our data from previously published news articles. Because we are basically evaluating whether a person’s article is true or false, in some way, we are criticizing the person’s work. Therefore, by providing data that a person’s work is wrong, it may harm the person’s career. We also think that this may also bring up privacy issues because we are using someone else’s work and evaluating it without the publisher’s permission. However, we believe that this will not be that much of a problem because news itself will always be biased in some sort of way and it is the reader’s responsibility to take in only correct information. Therefore, we believe that our project serves a good purpose because it helps the reader’s to make correct decisions in trusting the correct news article. "
