    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of our project is to classify if a news is fake or not. The data we are using is scraped from snopes.com which is a website that fact checks and analyzes information from the news. The variables in the dataset include: the title, comments by the public on the fact, claims to support the comment, label of the news(True, False, Miscaptioned), summary of the content, information that are true, false and unknown. We will be using these data to understand how each variable affects on the validity of the news content. In order to validate if the news is fake or not, we will be using multivariable logistic regression. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As SNS spreads rapidly, fake news disguised as the media remains a major social problem. Fake news has become a particular public issue for the following reason:"
    "\n",
    "As online public opinion spheres are activated, people have diverse and easy access to platforms such as YouTube, and SNS. Unverified issues are produced and spread easily in that they can be freely spoken and shared information and opinions, making it easy for anyone to make news that may be extreme or wrongful, and spread them.",
    "\n",
    "Since 2017, academic research and discussion have gotten in earnest in the United States, where fake news remarked by Trump has been shifted to fake news. According to previous discussions up to date, fake news has been broadly defined as A) for political and economic gain, B) deliberately distorting and fabricating, and C) false information disguised as media coverage.",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of artificial intelligence and various technology to distinguish fake news and unidentified information by SNS, media companies, also with the emergence of several fact-checking media show that "media literacy" has become a must for modern people."

Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once)."

    "Solution: multivariable logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Library used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our problem is a binary classification of evaluating if the news is true or false, we will be using logistic regression. In order to process the test into input data, we will be using vectorization. Then we will be adding this vectorized input to variables from multiple columns and evaluate whether the news is true or false. Thus, we will be using multivariable logistic regression. First of all, we will be dividing the dataset into training/validation set and test set. Next, because vectorizing the text into word units creates too many variables, we will be using normalization. Because we will be needing strong normalization, we believe that using L1 normalization will be effective. The search plane itself is a vectorized text, therefore it is possible for it to become very high dimension which may result in being stuck in the local minima. In order to prevent this problem, we will be using momentum in our training. Also, in order to quickly do weight updates in training, we will be using mini-batch. In the validation step, we will be using K-fold cross validation to retreive the most accurate model. "

Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms)."

    "In our dataset, there may be some potential ethical concerns because we are retrieving our data from previously published news articles. Because we are basically evaluating whether a person’s article is true or false, in some way, we are criticizing the person’s work. Therefore, by providing data that a person’s work is wrong, it may harm the person’s career. We also think that this may also bring up privacy issues because we are using someone else’s work and evaluating it without the publisher’s permission. However, we believe that this will not be that much of a problem because news itself will always be biased in some sort of way and it is the reader’s responsibility to take in only correct information. Therefore, we believe that our project serves a good purpose because it helps the reader’s to make correct decisions in trusting the correct news article. "
