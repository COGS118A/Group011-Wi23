    "The goal of our project is to classify if a news is fake or not. The data we are using is scraped from snopes.com which is a website that fact checks and analyzes information from the news. The variables in the dataset include: the title, comments by the public on the fact, claims to support the comment, label of the news(True, False, Miscaptioned), summary of the content, information that are true, false and unknown. We will be using these data to understand how each variable affects on the validity of the news content. In order to validate if the news is fake or not, we will be using multivariable logistic regression. \n"

Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once)."

    "\n",
    "Library used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our problem is a binary classification of evaluating if the news is true or false, we will be using logistic regression. In order to process the test into input data, we will be using vectorization. Then we will be adding this vectorized input to variables from multiple columns and evaluate whether the news is true or false. Thus, we will be using multivariable logistic regression. First of all, we will be dividing the dataset into training/validation set and test set. Next, because vectorizing the text into word units creates too many variables, we will be using normalization. Because we will be needing strong normalization, we believe that using L1 normalization will be effective. The search plane itself is a vectorized text, therefore it is possible for it to become very high dimension which may result in being stuck in the local minima. In order to prevent this problem, we will be using momentum in our training. Also, in order to quickly do weight updates in training, we will be using mini-batch. In the validation step, we will be using K-fold cross validation to retreive the most accurate model. "

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",

    "The evaluation metrics we will be using will be True positive rate (recall) and Accuracy. For recall, we will be using (correctly evaluating that news is false) / (correctly evaluating that news is false + evaluating that news is true when it is actually false). This recall rate is important for our problem because it tells us the rate of us being able to correctly evaluate that the news is false. For Accuracy, we will be using (correctly evaluating that news is false + evaluating that news is false when it is actually true) / (correctly evaluating that news is false + correctly evaluating that news is true + evaluating that news is true when it is actually false + evaluating that news is false when it is actually true). Accuracy is important for our problem because it tells us if our model was able to accurately make correct predictions in evaluating that the news is false."

    "In our dataset, there may be some potential ethical concerns because we are retrieving our data from previously published news articles. Because we are basically evaluating whether a person’s article is true or false, in some way, we are criticizing the person’s work. Therefore, by providing data that a person’s work is wrong, it may harm the person’s career. We also think that this may also bring up privacy issues because we are using someone else’s work and evaluating it without the publisher’s permission. However, we believe that this will not be that much of a problem because news itself will always be biased in some sort of way and it is the reader’s responsibility to take in only correct information. Therefore, we believe that our project serves a good purpose because it helps the reader’s to make correct decisions in trusting the correct news article. "
